Host table library

What is this?
-------------

This directory contains two things:

1. A library of functions for manipulating host tables, which are
   included in programs that need it by specifying "-lhosts" when
   compiling.

2. Routines to generate a run-time loadable host table that also
   includes who the host we are running on is.

The hosttab.h file should be put into /usr/include and included in
programs using the library.  This is done in "make install".

The hosttab.global file should contain the currently distributed
global host table.  "hosttab.local" contains things to add to the host
table for hosts not in the global table but accessible from this host.
Normally, if you are not on the ARPA net, hosttab.global is empty.

Look in hosttab.sample for thr format of these files.

To win you must make hosttab.local hosttab.global, then run "make
install" as super user.
