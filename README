Chaosnet for UNIX

What is this?
-------------

Chaosnet was an early (pre-ethernet) computer network developed at
MIT.  It was an early "common bus" packet network, i.e. all the
machines shared a single "wire" and sent packets back and forth.

Chaosnet was used to connect many machines at MIT, most notably the
PDP-10's running ITS and the Lisp Machines.

This is a port of some really really old BSD kernel code to modern day
GNU/Linux.

The CADR simulator (usim) can be a client and uses this code to talk
to the FILE server ("FILE" is the file serving protocol used on
Chaosnet).


Quickstart
----------

To start the "server", load the Chaosnet kernel driver, initialize it
and then start "chserver".

Some client side programs used to test functionality:

	chinit - init protocol stack
	cheaddr - set ethernet address
	cftp HOST - simple 'ftp like' file transfer program
	chtime HOST - gets time from HOST
	hostat HOST - gets packet statistics from HOST


Kernel driver
-------------

Psuedo device connected to "/dev/chaos" fields ioctl's.
	CHIOCOPEN returns a new fd in user space
	CHIOCACCEPT accepts a new connection
	CHIOCREJECT rejects a new connection

Psuedo device connected to "/dev/churfc" allows reads
 	CHIOCILADDR to set choas address

Driver needs to do open/close/ioctl/read/write and be able to create
new fd's in user space.

Recent Changes
--------------

????-??-?? - TBD

2006-07-11 - Fixed FILE server to force everything to lower case
               (still a bug in close - don't open multiple files).
             Some MacOS fixes, doesnt' work yet in big endian
             Works well enough to support SI:RECOMPILE-WORLD.

2005-12-13 - Original release.
