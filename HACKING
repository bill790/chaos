Hacking tips and notes

Chaosnet fun in QEMU
--------------------

  Ctrl-Alt-1 - Target system display
  Ctrl-Alt-2 - Monitor
  Ctrl-Alt-3 - Serial port

Step one is to seutp a basic system that we can use for debugging:

	BR=buildroot-2017.11.2
	wget https://buildroot.org/downloads/${BR}.tar.gz
	tar xf ${BR}.tar.gz
	cd ${BR}
	make BR_EXTERNAL=../chaosnet-br2ext chaosnet_x86_64_defconfig
	make

Given that, we can start it up in qemu and use it as a basis for any
furture hacking:

    qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel output/images/bzImage -hda output/images/rootfs.ext2 -append "root=/dev/sda"
