CHAOSNET

What was I thinking?

------ kernel -------

psuedo device connected to "/dev/chaos" fields ioctl's.
	CHIOCOPEN returns a new fd in user space
	CHIOCACCEPT accepts a new connection
	CHIOCREJECT rejects a new connection

psuedo device connected to "/dev/churfc" allows reads
	CHIOCILADDR to set choas address

driver needs to do open/close/ioctl/read/write and be able to create
new fd's in user space.
